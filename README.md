Important code snippets for linked-list, doubly-linked-lists:


const node = new LinkedListNode(data);

FOR INDEXED
let current, previous;
// Set current to first
current = this.head;
let count = 0;
while (count < index) {
previous = current;

FOR NON-INDEXED
while (currentNode.next) {
currentNode = currentNode.next;
}
