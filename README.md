Important code snippets for linked-list, doubly-linked-lists:
const node = new LinkedListNode(data);

FOR INDEXED
let current, previous;
// Set current to first
current = this.head;
let count = 0;
while (count < index) {
previous = current;

FOR NON-INDEXED
while (currentNode.next) {
currentNode = currentNode.next;
}

Print elements of a linked list in reverse order using recursion (WITHOUT REVERSING THE LINKED -LIST)

//rk ==> reverseTraversal 0f LL  using RECURSION
//==> BASICALLY IT WORKS ON THE PRINCIPLE like ==> function adds into stack and gets completely executed later !!!
